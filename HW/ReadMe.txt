Homework ;-)

Purpose: 	To gather (via crowdsourcing our group) a set of data sources, algorithms of interest, and 
		potential project ideas (or presentation requests) to be used by the Data Club.

Guideline: 	The more relevant information included the better, but please also try to provide a concise 
		introduction / description.

-----------------------------------------------------
The following apply to text files in their respective directories:

DataSources -- 	describes a source(s) of available data that can be publically accessed. Please include 
		examples (including how to access), but it is not necessary to copy a full set of data.

Algorithms -- 	can be as simple as linking to a Wikipedia article, for a request to have someone in the 
		group investigate further (and update the file), to providing intimate details of an 
		algorithm.

ProjectIdeas -- a place for thoughts on something interesting to do or investigate / topic areas for 
		presentations / or full project specifications. They can be totally novel or implementations 
		and/or adaptations of public works, academic papers, and anything in-between.
