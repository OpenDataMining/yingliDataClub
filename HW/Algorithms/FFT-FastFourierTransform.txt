FFT -- Fast Fourier Transform

Description: 	An optimization of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) that converts time (or space) to the 
		frequency domain. It is useful for many types of data analysis (spectral, differential 
		modelling, etc.) and signal & image processing. Please also refer to the Inverse Fast Fourier 
		Transform (IFFT). The best known runtime complexity is O(NLogN).

Notes:		It might be useful to give a formal presentation of this algorithm, including continuous
		Fourier transformations, and similar transformations (Wavelets).
